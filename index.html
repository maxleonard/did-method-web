      DIDs that target a distributed ledger face significant practical
      challenges in bootstrapping enough meaningful trusted data around
      identities to incentivize mass adoption. 
      We propose a new DID method using a web domain's existing reputation.

    <section>
      <h2>
        Target system
      </h2>
      <p>
        The target system of the Web DID method is the web host that the domain
        name described by the DID resolves to when queried through the Domain
        Name System (DNS).
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
        Method name
      </h2>
      <p>
        The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>web</code>.

        A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix:
        <code>did:web</code>. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in
        lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix, is specified
        below.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
        Method-specific identifier
      </h2>
      <p>
        The method specific identifier is a fully qualified domain name that is
        secured by a TLS/SSL certificate with an optional path to the DID
        document. The formal rules describing valid domain name syntax are
        described in [[RFC1035]], [[RFC1123]], and [[RFC2181]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The method specific identifier MUST match the common name used in the
        SSL/TLS certificate, and it MUST NOT include IP addresses. A port MAY be
        included and the colon MUST be percent encoded to prevent a conflict
        with paths. Directories and subdirectories MAY optionally be included,
        delimited by colons rather than slashes.

      </h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          There is intentionally no HTTP API specified for did:web method
          operations leaving programmatic registrations and management to be
          defined by each implementation, or based on their own requirements in
          their web environment.
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3>
          Create (Register)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Creating a DID is done by:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            applying at a domain name registrar for use of a domain name and
          </li>
          <li>
            storing the location of a hosting service, the IP address at a DNS
            lookup service
          </li>
          <li>
            creating the DID document JSON-LD file including a suitable keypair,
            e.g. using the Koblitz Curve, and storing the <code>did.json</code>
            file under the well-known URL to represent the entire domain, or
            under the specified path if many DIDs will be resolved in this
            domain.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          For example, for the domain name `w3c-ccg.github.io`, the `did.json`
          will be available under the following URL:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Creating the DID">
did:web:w3c-ccg.github.io
 -> https://w3c-ccg.github.io/.well-known/did.json
          </pre>

        <p>
          If an optional path is specified rather the bare domain, the
          <code>did.json</code> will be available under the specified path:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="Creating the DID with optional path">
did:web:w3c-ccg.github.io:user:alice
 -> https://w3c-ccg.github.io/user/alice/did.json
          </pre>

        <p>
          If an optional port is specified on the domain, the port colon
          splitting the host and the port MUST be percent encoded to prevent
          collision with the path.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="Creating the DID with optional path and port">
did:web:example.com%3A3000:user:alice
 -> https://example.com:3000/user/alice/did.json
          </pre>
      </section>

        <h3>
          Read (Resolve)
        </h3>
        <p>
          The following steps MUST be executed to resolve the DID document from
          a Web DID:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Replace ":" with "/" in the method specific identifier to obtain the
            fully qualified domain name and optional path.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the domain contains a port percent decode the colon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generate an HTTPS URL to the expected location of the DID document
            by prepending <code>https://</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If no path has been specified in the URL, append
            <code>/.well-known</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Append <code>/did.json</code> to complete the URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            Perform an HTTP <code>GET</code> request to the URL using an agent
            that can successfully negotiate a secure HTTPS connection, which
            enforces the security requirements as described in <a
              href="#security-and-privacy-considerations"></a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            When performing the DNS resolution during the HTTP <code>GET</code>
            request, the client SHOULD utilize [[RFC8484]] in order to prevent
            tracking of the identity being resolved.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          To update the DID document, the <code>did.json</code> has to be
          updated. Please note that the DID will remain the same, but the
          contents of the DID document could change, e.g., by including a new
          verification key or adding service endpoints.

          This DID method does not specify any authentication or authorization

        <p>
          It is up to implementer to secure their web environments according to

          based on the specific needs of their threat environment.

        <h3>
          DNS Considerations
        </h3>
        <h4>
          DNS Security Considerations
        </h4>
        <p>
          DNS presents many of the attack vectors that enable active security
          and privacy attacks on the did:web method and it's important that
          implementors address these concerns via proper configuration of DNS.
          For example, without proper security of the DNS resolution via <a
            href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484">DNS over HTTPS</a> it's
          possible for active attackers to intercept the result of the DNS
          resolution via a Man in the Middle attack which would point at a
          malicious server with the incorrect DID Document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, implementors should be aware of issues presented by a
          Spoofed DNS records where the record returned by a malicious DNS
          Server is inauthentic and allows the record to be pointed at a
          malicious server which contains a different DID Document. To prevent
          this type of issue, usage of DNSSEC which is
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033">RFC4033</a>,
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4034">RFC4034</a>, and
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4035">RFC4035</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>
          DNS Privacy Considerations
        </h4>
        <p>
          Due to the nature of the did:web method relying upon a DNS in order to
          resolve the web server, all resolutions of a did:web identifier have
          the potential to be tracked by a DNS provider. Additionally, due to
          the DID Document being stored on a web server, each time the DID
          Document resource is retrieved, the web server has the ability to
          track the resolution of the DID Document. To mitigate the issue of the
          relying party being tracked when resolving the DID Document the
          relying party should look to either use a trusted universal resolver
          service to gain herd privacy, utilize a VPN service or perform a
          resolution over the TOR network. Another emerging solution that will
          be useful to address this is <a
            href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pauly-dprive-oblivious-doh-03">

        <h3>
          DID Document Integrity Verification
        </h3>

        <p>
          Additional mechanisms such as <a
            href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sporny-hashlink">Hashlinks</a>
          MAY be utilized to aid in integrity protection and verification of the
          DID document.
          <br />
          Under such a scenario the hash of the DID document could be recorded
          to a trusted or distributed store and the retriever of the DID
          document would generate a hash of the DID document in their posession
          with the hash retrieved to ensure that no tampering with the DID
          document had occurred.

          In-transit Security

        <p>
          At least TLS 1.2 should be configured to use only strong ciphers
          suites and to use sufficiently large key sizes. As recommendations may
          be volatile these days, only the very latest recommendations should be
          used. However, as a rule of thumb, the following must be used:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Ephemeral keys are to be used.
          </li>
          <li>
            ECDHE with one of the strong curves {X25519, brainpoolP384r1, NIST
            P-384, brainpoolP256r1, NIST P-256} shall be used as key exchange.
          </li>
          <li>
            AESGCM or ChaCha20 with 256 bit large keys shall be used for bulk
            encryption
          </li>
          <li>
            ECDSA with one of the strong curves {brainpoolP384r1, NIST P-384,
            brainpoolP256r1, NIST P-256} or RSA (at least 3072) shall be used.

        <h3>
          Optional Path Considerations
        </h3>
        <p>
          When optional paths to DID documents are used to resolve documents
          rather than bare domains, verification with signed data proves that
          the entity in control of the file indicated in the path has the
          private keys. It does not prove that the domain operator has the
          private keys.
        </p>

        <p>
          This example:
        </p>

        <pre class="nohighlight">
did:web:example.com:u:bob
          </pre>
        <p>
          resolves to the DID document at:
        </p>
        <pre class="nohighlight">
https://example.com/u/bob/did.json
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this scenario, it is probable that example.com has given user Bob
          control over the DID in question, and proofs of control refer to Bob
          rather than all of example.com.
